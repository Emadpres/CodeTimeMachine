# Code Time Machine
The **Code Time Machine** is a lightweight IntelliJ IDE plugin which uses visualization techniques to depict the history of any chosen file augmented with information mined from the underlying versioning system. Inspired by Appleâ€™s Time Machine, this tool allows both developers and the system itself to seamlessly move through time.

Read more about the tool and its use-cases at ["The Code Time Machine" paper](http://www.inf.usi.ch/phd/aghajani/resources/papers/agha2017a.pdf), published at International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC) 2017, by [Emad Aghajani](http://www.inf.usi.ch/phd/aghajani), [Andrea Mocci](http://www.inf.usi.ch/postdoc/mocci), [Gabriele Bavota](http://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/bavota) and [Michele Lanza](http://www.inf.usi.ch/faculty/lanza).

## Installation
### Binary
To install using pre-built  binary, first download [the latest release](https://github.com/Emadpres/CodeTimeMachine/releases/latest). Then, go to `IntelliJ IDE | Preference | Plugin | install plugin from Hard`.

### Source code
- **Using in-project IDEA project files**:
After cloning and opening the project via IntelliJ IDEA, you need to follow [Setting Up a Development Environment](./docs/setup-and-deploy.md#i-setting-up-a-development-environment) section. Afterwards, create a new `Run | Edit Configuration | + | Plugin` and use the newly created *IntelliJ Platform SDK* as the SDK (requires Java 1.8+).
- **Creating the project from scratch**:
Follow both [Setting Up a Development Environment and Creating a Plugin Project](./docs/setup-and-deploy.md#i-setting-up-a-development-environment) steps and copy relevant files (sources, resources, ...) to corresponding folders in your own project. (Please open an [issue](https://github.com/Emadpres/CodeTimeMachine/issues) if you face any issue)

In the end, deploy the project by following the [Deploying a Plugin](./docs/setup-and-deploy.md#deploying-a-plugin) section.
